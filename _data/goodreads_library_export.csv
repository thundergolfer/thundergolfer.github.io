Blandly written, like the author was doing a school assignment they barely cared about. Late on in the book the author begins a paragraph by introducing Ray Kurzweil as if she hadn't been discussing him plenty in literally the previous chapter.<br/><br/>A stupid amount of name-dropping; most of the book is a name-drop followed by quotes from the name-dropped. Much of the argumentation in the book is spurious, and the argumentation that's at least correct is really not impressive because it's basically always given to counter an argument that's so obviously dumb it wasn't worth the ink to refute it. <br/><br/>Best bit: being offered a shitload of jumping off-points for further reading, because the author name-drops so much.<br/>Worst bit: The author's embarrassingly dumb argument against environmental damage from population growth. Richer people show more ""concern"" for the environment apparently, so no need to worry about climate change because the poor countries are all getting richer and the rich countries already treat the planet so well!","","","1","0"
