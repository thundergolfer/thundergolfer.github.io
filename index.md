# 👋 Hi there, <br/> I'm Jonathon Belotti. 

## Thanks for stopping by.

---

I'm a software engineer with a focus on data & platform engineering.  


I can usually be found in a programming IDE or reading. 
I'm bullish on, and a big booster of:

* 🌿💚 [@bazelbuild](https://github.com/bazelbuild/) and generally using functional principles to keep things sane. (I've open-sourced a few tools for the Bazel ecosystem, see [/projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects))
* Good old-fashioned books 📖. Two recent favourites are [_Dune_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune) and [_Constructing The Political Spectacle_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/348524.Constructing_the_Political_Spectacle)
* [Effective Altruism](https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/vox/the-ezra-klein-show/e/65717914). Helping, not harming. Doing, not having. Building, not consuming.
